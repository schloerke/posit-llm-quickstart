 When the stars make you too, would you still like a pastif, for so long, that's smaller. When your dance down the street, we think a lot of you are feeling low. When you walk in a dream, but you know you're not dreaming in your head. Excuse me, but you see back in old Napoli that's smaller. When long, when your life like the big picture, I have some more hair. That's more hair. When the world speaks to shine like you've had too much more hair. That's smaller. That's really. Single thing, you'll ain't single thing. You sing, beat the bell. Beat the bell, beat the bell. What's we'll play? Beat the bell, beat the bell. Like a gay child. What do you feel? When the stars make you too, would you still like a pastif, That was too much, some more room. That's a whole day. When you're there, it's time to sleep.
