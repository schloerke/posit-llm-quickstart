 That sunshine in my pocket Not that good song in my feet I feel that habit in my pocket The limit drops Oh, I can't take my eyes off of it Been so fun on the moon The moon will lock the baby rocket So stop that Yeah, another light When everything goes No matter how high When I'm getting you close When we're moving Where you already know To just relax You can see but you're a little bit I can see but you're a little bit Stay as a girl, I'm so quick and not wrong You should just stay as fast Stay as calm, I'm so fast I should do good but you stay as fast Stay as fast I'm not about to leave Been so sweet, stay as fast I got you out of the bed I can't take my eyes off of it So just stay as fast Oh, I was something magical It's in the air It's in my blood, it's Russian Not a version, don't need no reason Don't need control I'll pass on high I'll pass on high
