Amazon Prime Big Deal Days are running through today, offering some epic deals on items from allll the categories — home, electronics, travel and recreation, apparel, toys and games, wellness and beauty, and much more.  There’s a LOT to browse, so I’m recommending some things that I think are good buys for a variety of reasons:  some we have and love, some are great for the season, some would make excellent gifts, and some just seem like really good deals on handy items to have. See them all on the blog — link in bio!
