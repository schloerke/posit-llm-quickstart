This past July @Chocolate.City.Criterium and @EventsDC brought @USACycling sanctioned bike racing back to the city where it belongs: right here in the heart of D.C.! 🖤

Our local athletes and young stars took center stage, with families, friends, and neighbors lining the course in a true celebration of D.C.'s future in the sport. For so many kids, this was the first time their parents could watch them race live, made possible by a Metro-accessible location that welcomed everyone. Watching kids feel the pride of riding their hometown streets, with the cheers of their people behind them, is exactly what this sport needs.

But this was more than a race—it was a moment of unity, pride, and community. From the cheers to the finish line, we saw the power of giving our youth a space to shine in their own city. We hope to see everyone back here next year, bigger, better, and faster! Here’s to creating more spaces where our local athletes and youth are the stars!  🚴🏽‍♀️🚴🏾‍♂️
