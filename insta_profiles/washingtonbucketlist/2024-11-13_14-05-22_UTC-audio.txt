 I waited 45 minutes in line to try this super popular breakfast sandwich at the DuPont farmers market This is the hog haven breakfast sandwich and it comes with a homemade English muffin super thin sausage party egg Irish cheddar cheese and roasted tomato way elite you can also have additional toppings like caramelized onions and bacon and get their house made hot sauces The caramelized onion was definitely our favorite. We also tried their house made pomegranate lemonade And I definitely recommend eating this in the park away from the chaos. This is definitely the best breakfast sandwich I've had in DC
