If you’re looking for an easy getaway from DC, you can take the train down to Williamsburg, VA, and step into the WORLD’S LARGEST living history museum!

@VisitWilliamsburg has a ton of history that is worth exploring and is presented in a thoughtful and unique way, making it worthwhile for every history lover.
 
But adding in the train?? Snacks and bathrooms available without having to stop? Being able to get up and walk around? Heaven. Makes it such an easy trip from DC to get some house dressing from @cheeseshopva and explore @colonialwmsburg & @merchantssquare.
