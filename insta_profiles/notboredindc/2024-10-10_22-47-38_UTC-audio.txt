 This meal is so good that I didn't want to make a video about it. I wanted to stay in the moment and enjoy the food, but I do want to talk about it. I've been hearing about Penny Royal Station. I never got a chance to go there until I went kayaking with a friend, and we stopped on the way back. And these papus are around chairs like look at that cheese. I cannot stop thinking about this meal. I friend got the chicken sandwich, so it was delicious, beautiful crunch, beautiful seasoning. Highly recommend that too. We got some delicious mocktails on the patio. So fruity and refreshing. Pettios great vibes. Flower murals all over the exterior. Shaded seating. Penny Royal Station is beautiful inside too.
