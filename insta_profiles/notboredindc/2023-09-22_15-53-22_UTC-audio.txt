 This hot dog stand is the top rated 1 in DC and has over 715 star reviews. What makes it different from all of the others? This stand has been here 30 years and if you ask Sammy the owner he'll tell you it's because of the homemade chili and his top secret spice blend. I had never thought to add spices to the water while cooking hot dogs but it adds a layer of complexity that you don't get with a normal hot dog. I got a chili cheese dog with a spicy hot dog and even then the spice blend still came through. There's a park across the street where you can eat with views of the capital and it's close by to the mall and long-fong. With all the options for tapping, unique flavors and just how nice Sammy is it makes sense wide.
