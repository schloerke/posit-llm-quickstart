FUN THING TO DO IN THE DMV: Kayaking on the Anacostia. I’m doing my dream partnership with @enjoytheanacostia because I want everyone to get outside and experience what the Anacostia watershed has to offer.

Bladensburg Waterfront Park (part of @pgparksandrec) is just over the DC border, and you can rent a kayak or canoe and paddle your way down into DC. Rentals are for 3 hours, and you can snag a discount if you book ahead of time or if you are a PG or MoCo resident.

We kayaked down into @kenilworthnps into the lagoon that I’ve only ever seen from the boardwalk. It was a pretty day for a leisurely paddle!
