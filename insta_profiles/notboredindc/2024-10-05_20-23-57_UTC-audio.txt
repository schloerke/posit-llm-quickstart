 Theodore Roosevelt Island in DC used to be a refugee camp. During the Civil War, as people were escaping from slavery, the government was kind of scrambling to figure out what to do with all these people. They set up what were known as contraband camp for freed people would come and live and work. Keep in mind that the most liberal charities at the time were focused on making good workers out of people. freed men's village contraband camp in Arlington was a working government run farm, but it and others like it were getting overwhelmed with the amount of people. The government decided to set up a new camp on what was known as Mason's Island. The government felt that the freed men's village was too comfortable and was discouraging hard work. That's very reflective of the racial stereotypes at the time and have really good reminder that just because black people were now free didn't mean that white saw them as equal. On Mason's Island, they designed it as Spartan at best to discourage people from staying there for a while. The goal of the camp at Mason's Island was to find private employment for everyone who went through, but it quickly got overcrowded. At its height in July 1864, 1200 people lived on the island. The government would place the formerly enslaved with employers, but the employers wouldn't always pay them or let them leave. Effectively re-inslaving them like what happened with the Holland family. The camp on Mason's Island lasted a little over a year and was shut down after the civil war ended. There's a great story map I've linked to that goes into it, including more about the Holland family story if you want to learn more.
