 Your dog can be sworn in as a barcanger at Rock Creek Park in DC. Rock Creek launched their barcanger program last year and on Saturday they'll be having a nature walk in swaring in ceremony at the visitor center of the lottery road. That's a 10 a.m. but from 11 to 1 at the visitor center you can also get your dog sworn in by the park Rangers. It is Halloween so don't be shy about dressing up for the occasion. Last year at the launch they didn't have badges but they did have certificates that like pledge your dog will follow the park Ranger rules and is a really pretty way to spend the day and enjoy the fall scenery.
