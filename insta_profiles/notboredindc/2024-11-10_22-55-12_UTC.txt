The gingko grove at the State Arboretum/Blandy Experimental Farm is one of the largest in the country and is at the carpeting stage, where the yellow leaves have mostly fallen off the trees and are creating a beautiful foliage cover on the ground.

It took me 1.5 hours to get there from NW DC. The ginkgo trees in dc should be at peak foliage soon!
