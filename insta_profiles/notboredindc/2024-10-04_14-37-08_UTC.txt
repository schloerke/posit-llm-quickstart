It’s Open Streets DC and @ddotdc is closing 7th Street NW between Rhode Island and E to traffic to make way for pedestrians, music, and other activations. So take the metro @metroforward !

Last year, it was Georgia Avenue, and I walked the entire length and back, stopping by local businesses like @heresthescoopdc and @simplebarandgrill along the way—highly recommend you do the same this year on 7th!
