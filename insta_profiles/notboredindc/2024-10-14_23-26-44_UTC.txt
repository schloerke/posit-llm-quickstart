Where to find bright red foilage in DC, because to me, that’s the foliage I want to see!

Red maples have started turning the bright red now (Oct 14 2024), but it will probably take another week for them to hit peak. They’re also the most common street tree in DC.

Sugar maples also turn a beautiful red, but their leaves are not turning yet. The photo of the sugar maple is from Nov 18 2023.

And of course, red isn’t the only color-all the colors make for a beautiful walk, like we did on Beach Drive last year
