 The world's largest living history museum is just a train ride away from DC. The Amtrak drops you off in the heart of colonial Williamsburg so close to Merchins Square with the Chee Shop and their famous house dressing right there. We could walk right over to colonial Williamsburg to learn from the historical interpreters about what life was like in 1700s in English, America. It's so much more in-depth than reading placards. You're asking specialists in each area so you can get all of your questions answered. Writing the train was so easy, we had plenty of room and easy access to snacks in the cafe car while enjoying the views.
