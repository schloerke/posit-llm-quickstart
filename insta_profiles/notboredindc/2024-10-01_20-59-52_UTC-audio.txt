 Your perfect spooky season getaway is waiting for you in Williamsburg. First, Bush Gardens Hall's Cream had a screaming from the rollercoasters in haunted houses definitely but also the people jumping out and chasing us around the park. Your town may seem peaceful during the day but at night the candlelight goes toward letters through the town's hauntings including the revolutionary and civil wars which saw large battles here. Williamsburg also has ghost stores that tell you about the people that once lived there and I don't know I think it's all a ghost at one of the notoriously haunted houses. At Cry Witch you're getting involved in a historic witchcraft trial and they accused witches' fate is in the audience's hands so don't get cursed. If you prefer treats of her tricks the wif candy shop also has a ton of fun spooky treats like truffles gummies and caramel apples that will put you in the Halloween mood.
