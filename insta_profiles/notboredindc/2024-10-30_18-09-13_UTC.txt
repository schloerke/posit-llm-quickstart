Pick your own apples this at FT Valley Farm, not far from Old Rag.

Near Sperryville, Virginia, it’s about 2 hours from DC near Old Rag, and is doing pick your own apples until Sunday, November 10. It is further than some other pick your own orchards, but they allow dogs and have lots of different varieties.

Sperryville is a cute small town on the way to Old Rag, @rpksperryvilleva has some good pizza too if you’re looking for a pit stop!
