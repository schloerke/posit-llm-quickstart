 Your dog can go on a scavenger hunt to become an official great falls bark Ranger and earn a badge. At great falls on the Virginia side, they have an info table with how to become a bark Ranger. You need to take photos of your dog doing three things around the park and enjoying it responsibly. When you're done, knock on the office door and they'll check your photos to confirm your dog truly earned its badge. They'll get awarded a great falls bark Ranger badge which could be a little Mikey's twin. The badge is free but there isn't entrance fee at the park of $20 per car. Now that Ranger Wiggles has two bark Ranger locations on his resume, his career is on the fast track and I can't wait to celebrate his next promotion.
