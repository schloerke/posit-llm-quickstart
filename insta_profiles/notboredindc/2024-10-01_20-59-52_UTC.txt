Halloween in Virginia’s Historic Triangle is extra spooky, and I’m partnering with @visitwilliamsburg to bring you the spookiest things to do around Williamsburg (less than 3 hours from Washington DC).

🧟‍♂️ Howl-O-Scream at @buschgardensva turns the park into a creepy kingdom at night on weekends, with screams from the rides and cast members keeping you on your toes

👻 Search for ghosts in Yorktown, the site of historic battles and more, with @yorktownghostwalks

😱 Explore Colonial Williamsburg at night and learn about the ghosts who live there with a @colonialghosts ghost tour

🍬 Halloween isn’t complete without treats! Find cute (and tasty!) Halloween sweets at @wythecandy
