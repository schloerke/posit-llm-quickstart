 Love its blindy seas here, let's talk about the spots where they were spotted filming. Urban roast down in Chinatown is known for its flower walls and ceilings, so it makes a lot of sense that they filmed here because it is perfect for cameras. There were also some cast members filming in Christus' edicts park in La Droit Park. Not sure if it's the whole cast, it just looks like a small group. Christus' edicts park is nestled away in an alien, it's named after the first person who died in the American Revolution, a black man named Christus' edicts. There was some speculation that it was filmed at Red Light on 14th Street after there was a notice on the door, even pretty solid happy hour and good to trick so it's a piece of your interested. There was a spotting of Nick and Vanessa at Martin's Heaven in Georgetown though it wasn't clear whether they were actually filming or just hanging out because you know the whole like Jackie and JFK booth is there and they seem very romantic and might be into that. Crown and Crochette was trying to cast in on that they say that love is blinders filmed there and are advertising it on the street. I also heard that they were filming at a winery though I don't know which one, I'm really looking forward to when they get out of the pods and they get to explore the city and I get to see where they go and because I am nosy. You know they don't really talk about like their experiences at the places like the food and the drinks but I would love to actually hear like a component of the show talking about reviews of each place.
