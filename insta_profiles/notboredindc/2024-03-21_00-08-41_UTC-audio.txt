 D.C.'s hottest neighborhood is Caltown. When Washington D.C. was founded, it wasn't just one city. It was a number of counties in cities. On the northern end of the city was boundary road, which is now Florida Avenue. On the northern tip of the city, above where Florida Avenue meets U Street was Caltown. In the city of Washington, people weren't allowed to just let their livestock run free, but north of the city in the county of Washington they were. So just over the border of the city, that's where you had the dairy farms that would supply the city with fresh milk every day. A lot of them were concentrated on this block, which is between what's now very place in Eucalyph. In 1871, the city and the county both came under the territorial government though. And with that, Caltown allowed to roam free in Caltown anymore. Residents did not like that though, and anytime that the pound bastard tried to go into and force those rules, he had to go first of the police station because the residents would throw bricks and stuff at him. Most of it was later demolished for a banicur and other public works.
