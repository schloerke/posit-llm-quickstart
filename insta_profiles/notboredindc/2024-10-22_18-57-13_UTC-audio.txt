 You can go kayaking on this beautiful river and CDC from a different perspective. Bladen's bird waterfront park runs out kayaks and canuse so you can explore the Anakostia. We saw so many birds and turtles in jumping fish on the river and in the marshland and we took our time to soak it all in. You can go from Bladen's bird into DC easily and even kayaks around the canal worth aquatic gardens look good to see it from a different perspective. It feels like you are so far away from the city so if you're looking for a way to be at peace in nature without traveling that far, the Anakostia River is a beautiful backdrop that feels like a world away.
