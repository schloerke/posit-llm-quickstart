 The leaves are changing color in DC. Here's where you can find the best red leaves. This is a red maple. It's not at peak color yet, and you can see that up at the top is turning red, but the rest of it is not. Red maple is also happened to be the most popular street tree planted in DC with over 12,000 of them. And if you're going for a lot of them, capital hill has the largest density. You'll find those tree-lined streets on the north south roads, especially 7th street, 9th street and 10th street. But they truly are almost everywhere. I mean, look at this. Sugar maples are green right now, but soon they'll be this bright, brilliant red. The peak colors for the sugar maples are usually like 2 to 3 weeks after the red maple's so expect like, mid November, maybe? Keep your eyes out though. They're not as common as the red maples, but you'll see the biggest concentrations in Georgetown and again in capital hill. I think there's only like 4,000 or so of them, so like they're not everywhere in the city, but again, capital hill, Georgetown. Capital hill, they are on the east west streets more than the north south, those maples though, they are only the street trees they don't include the National Parks. They don't skip all the National Parks because like beach drive in rock creek park is beautiful to walk on and you'll see a wide variety of red, yellows and greens.
