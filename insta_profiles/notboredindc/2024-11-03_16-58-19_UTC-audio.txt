 The problem with the DC cheesecake factory is the ceiling height. A true cheesecake factory leans into the factory part of their heritage and makes you feel like you're walking into an old manufacturing plant. That's also kind of like an Italian temple with Roman deities watching you eat. But the one downtown in DC, it gives you none of that because it makes you feel like you're eating under 10 foot ceilings and not in a cavern of the world's finest cheesecake and not to choose. And when you look at cheesecake factory locations outside of DC, the ceilings are soaring like this one in fillet. The dining room has the right incoherent mix of the Travertean tile with the factory vibes and you can tell the ceilings are high because there are five levels of alcohol here and then still more ceiling. What should a DC enclaire it in you get the high ceilings and you'll find the deities perched up here watching everything go on. And Tice's corner has controversially high ceilings like look at this airspace and then in Chevy chase DC you walk in and you get this big kind of cavernous feel with the mural at the top but they're tricking you because look at how low this ceilings is only three levels. This is maybe a 15 footer but my real issues are with the one downtown I've never been to cheesecake factory with ceilings this low and it's not just because it's a downtown location because I think that they could move into the old forever 21 space and get those high ceilings that should be required at any cheesecake factory.
