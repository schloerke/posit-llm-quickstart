 The hottest events in DC are filling up quickly and I am not even joking when I tell you that holiday, volunteer shifts are some of the hardest things to come by. You really have to plan ahead. I made a list of places that still have volunteer opportunities available and also allow for just one-off shifts. A lot of places require you to go through a whole orientation and make a longer commitment, but all these places you can do like one-offs. I know this time of year, a lot of people like to focus on charities that focus on food insecurity. So for those, you'd be looking at like Martha's table, food for all DC, some Marilyn food bank, capital area food bank, Catholic, charities, Mana Food Center, and the Up County Hub. Because these are so popular for some of them, like you can't even get shifts around Thanksgiving anymore. You have to look into December. The other ones cover a wide variety of issues like helping children who are entering foster care, providing diapers to those who can't afford it and like job readiness stuff as well. Volunteering is one thing, but it's also come up with different ways that you can support the organization without going on a shift, like putting together holiday shoebox gifts for some with like a group of friends. If you're interested in volunteering and meeting new people, I'm organizing a volunteer shift with food for all right before Thanksgiving. We'll be packing grocery bags for homebound individuals in DC, but if you can't make this, I hope that you find something else that suits like what you need and your timeline for giving back to the DC community.
