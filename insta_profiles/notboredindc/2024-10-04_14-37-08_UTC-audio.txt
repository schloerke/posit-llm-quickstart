 It's Open Street CC this weekend here is a warning and a tip. Alright, first the warning. 7th Street is going to be closed for Rhode Island Avenue down to East Street to all traffic. So that's cars, buses, everything's going to be rerouted. Traffic is not going to be able to pass through, so if you need to get somewhere, try to take the metro. The point of open streets is to provide a pedestrian first reimagining of the city for a day. The road's close from 7am to 5pm. This was Georgia Avenue from Open Street last year, and we took the opportunity to walk the entire way from very place up to Missouri Avenue. Now I would recommend you do the same on 7th Street. It's a great way to explore local businesses. I want to hear the scoop got some ice cream. They have activities like concerts. This year it's on 7th Street in like China Town, but it was a lot of fun last year. I got to eat some delicious nachos at Simple Bar and Grill. I highly recommend that you take advantage of this opportunity and explore like the whole end of it from top to bottom and back.
