Read Me | Harry Potter: A Forbidden Forest Experience in Leesburg, VA 

⚡️🧙🏽 Illuminated trail with scenes from the movies and plenty of photo ops. From casting the Patronus to a wand duel, there’s a bit of interactiveness to this trail as well.

📌 Things to keep in mind:

- It’s COLD!!! We froze so wear plenty of layers.

- For the interactive portions that require a wand, one will be given to you but it was also convenient that we brought our own. They also have some for sale in their gift shop. 

- There are two gift shops; a smaller one as you walk into the trail & a larger one at the end of the trail. 

- There are port-a-potties (not the standard ones, a bit more luxurious lol) located in the village area and also about 3/4 of the way through the trail. 

- Jack got a bit scared walking through some parts of the forest and seeing some scenes like the dementors and Aragog (huge spider). In my opinion it’s best for kids ages 8+! 

- Yatzi of @kidsquarantineandme suggested bringing flashlights, which I think is a great idea! Check out her experience there listed on her page.
