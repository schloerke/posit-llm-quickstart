Read me | Family Day at the U.S. Library of Congress 

🇺🇸 Happy Veterans Day! This past Saturday we visited the Thomas Jefferson Building of the Library of Congress for their monthly Family Day activity. 

Each month, there’s a different theme with activities. November’s theme was “Families on the Home Front in WWI and WWII” for Veterans Day, where kids created their own Victory Garden. 

🥕 The “garden” came with a plant cup and crafting materials to create the garden and seeds once done. 

To go along with the theme, the Library also handed out pamphlets to further educate kids on rationing during the wars and additional exhibits to explore at the Library that related to the theme. 

🗓️ The next Family Day will be a Winter Holiday Celebration over three days, December 26th - 28th. Kids will be able to make their own holiday cards and bookmarks! Free timed tickets are required to participate. 

When’s the last time you visited @librarycongress?
